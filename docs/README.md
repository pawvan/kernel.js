# Kernel.js - Command Line Process Manager

Kernel.js is a **command-line process manager** written in JavaScript. It simulates a basic operating system environment, allowing users to manage processes within virtual folders. Users can start processes, list them, and stop them using simple commands, all through a command-line interface embedded in a web application.

## üöÄ Features

- **Start Processes**: Launch processes inside virtual folders.
- **List Processes**: View all running processes within a specific folder.
- **Stop Processes**: Stop a process by its unique ID.
- **Command-Line Interface**: A terminal-like interface for interacting with the system.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
/project-root
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /src/                     # Source files (for production code)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v16.x or higher)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pawvan/kernel.js.git
   cd kernel.js
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   If your project requires any dependencies, install them using:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   Open the `src/markup/index.html` file in your web browser. This will load the UI and allow you to interact with the command-line interface.

4. **Test the setup**:
   Run the kernel.js script to check if everything is working:
   ```bash
   node src/scripts/kernel.js
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

### Available Commands

- **Start a Process**:
  ```bash
  start /folder_name process_name
  ```
  Example:
  ```bash
  start /folder1 process1
  ```
  This command starts a process named `process1` in the `/folder1` folder.

- **List Running Processes in a Folder**:
  ```bash
  list /folder_name
  ```
  Example:
  ```bash
  list /folder1
  ```
  This will display all processes currently running in `/folder1`.

- **Stop a Process by ID**:
  ```bash
  stop /folder_name process_id
  ```
  Example:
  ```bash
  stop /folder1 1234567890
  ```
  This will stop the process with ID `1234567890` in the `/folder1` folder.

### Example Commands:

1. **Start a process**:
   ```bash
   start /folder1 process1
   ```

2. **List processes**:
   ```bash
   list /folder1
   ```

3. **Stop a process by ID**:
   ```bash
   stop /folder1 1234567890
   ```

## üìà Testing

To ensure that the core functionality works as expected, unit tests are provided in the `/test` directory.

### Running the Tests

Run the tests by executing the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

### Example Test:

```js
import { kernel } from '../src/scripts/kernel.js';

test('Starting, listing, and stopping processes', () => {
  let result = kernel.handleCommand('start /folder1 process1');
  expect(result).toContain('Started process: process1');

  result = kernel.handleCommand('list /folder1');
  expect(result).toContain('process1');

  const processId = kernel.folders['/folder1'][0].id;
  result = kernel.handleCommand(`stop /folder1 ${processId}`);
  expect(result).toContain('Stopped process');
});
```

## üéØ Roadmap

1. **Add Decoding**: Implement the decoding functionality to convert byte sequences back into the original string (coming soon).
2. **Expand Process Management**: Implement features such as pausing and resuming processes.
3. **Enhance User Interface**: Improve the UI for better user interaction and visual feedback.
4. **Cross-platform Support**: Ensure the command-line interface works on all major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
