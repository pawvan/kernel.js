Kernel.js
Kernel.js is a JavaScript project that simulates the core functionalities of a basic operating system kernel. This educational project demonstrates how kernels manage tasks and handle basic input/output operations.

Features
Task Management: Simulates task scheduling and management.
Input/Output Handling: Basic simulation of handling input and output operations.
Interactive Console: Provides a command-line interface for interacting with the simulated kernel.
Prerequisites
A modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
Basic understanding of JavaScript and web development
Project Structure
index.html: The main HTML file that sets up the environment.
styles.css: CSS file for styling the user interface.
kernel.js: JavaScript file that implements the kernel simulation.
Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/pawvan/kernel.js.git
cd kernel-js
Open index.html

Open index.html in your preferred web browser to start the kernel simulation.

Usage
Interact with the Kernel

After opening index.html, you'll see an interactive console. You can use the following commands:

status: Displays information about the current tasks and system status.
run [task]: Simulates running a specific task (e.g., run task1).
exit: Simulates exiting the kernel environment.
Customize the Simulation

Modify kernel.js to add more features or change how tasks are managed.
Adjust styles.css to change the appearance of the interactive console.
Code Overview
kernel.js: Contains the core logic of the kernel simulation, including task management and input/output handling.
styles.css: Provides styling for the user interface, including the console and display areas.
index.html: Sets up the HTML structure and links to the necessary CSS and JavaScript files.
